# Core Control

This is a work in progress update of [dd32's](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32/) [Core Control](https://wordpress.org/plugins/core-control/) plugin for WordPress.

Core Control is a set of plugin modules which can be used to control certain aspects of the WordPress Core. Currently, Core Control features modules for managing Filesystem Access, Managing plugin/theme/core updates, Managing HTTP Transports & External HTTP Request logging. More information can be found on the [plugin homepage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/core-control/).

We use this plugin every day to support our [Google Analytics by MonsterInsights](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) plugin but I've decided recently to contribute back by helping to develop a new version of the plugin that fixes most of the bugs we see while using the plugin each day.

This plugin version is not stable (constantly working on this new version during spare time). If you need stability, use the [official plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/core-control/).
